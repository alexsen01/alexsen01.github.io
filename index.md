This website gives an overview of some of the class-projects (Python and Power BI) done by me. In addition, for students or those interested, I have added some papers I created while in college.

# Projects

* ## Python
	* ***Python I (semester 1)***
		* Exercise a - version1
			* Description
				
				The exercise in this case was to make a game in which the user has to guess a code.
				These were the rules:
				* the code consists out of 4 numbers
				* only numbers 1 to 7 are allowed
				* each number can only occur once
				* the user only gets 10 tries
				* feedback is given after each attempt:
					* how many numbers are correct, but on the wrong place
					* how many numbers are correct, and on the correct place
				* user needs to be able to stop the game by entering the code '9999'
				
				Implement also the necessary checks
				
				This script was written before the lessons of lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, etc.
			
			* script: 
				- download link: [codebreaking - version 1](assets/img/Code-version-1-Senave_Alex_oef_workshop6_1.7.4.py)
				- Github link to script: ---to be added---
			
		* Exercise a - version2
			* Description
				
				This is the same exercise as before, but a few lessons further.
				
				In addition, it was asked to also generate an output file.
			
			* script: 
				- download link: [codebreaking - version 2](assets/img/Code-version-2-Senave_Alex_oef_workshop11_1.4.2.py)
				- Github link to script: ---to be added---			

		* End project
			* Description
		
				The assignment for completing this first course, was to create a mini escape room. 
				
				There are in total 10 riddles, and the user has to enter how many (s)he wants to solve.
				Entering '0' will end the game. Any other number will give him/her a random selection of this number of riddles out of the 10 possible. 
				After each attempt to solve a riddle, the user gets the feedback correct/wrong and is given the next one.
				
				At the end, a text file is given to the user, with the number of solved riddles, correct/wrong, and the average score.
				The user then also must be given the option to finish the game or to play again.

	* ***Python II (semester 2)***
		* Exercise a
			* Description
				
				Make a program that simulates a bank.
				All customers can deposit money without limit, but rules for withdrawing money depend on the type of customer:
				* gold member:
				
					can withdraw until a balance of -5000 euros
					
				* silver member:
				
					can withdraw until a balance of -2500 euros
					
					can only withdraw max 250 euros each time
					
				* bronze member:
				
					can not go below 0
					
					no limit on the max amount of money that can be withdrawn 
					
					(depending on the balance)
				
				Include the necessary checks
			
			* script: 
				- download link: [bank](assets/img/Senave_Alex_oef_workshop5_2.1.py)
				- Github link to script: ---to be added---			
	
		* Exercise b
			* Description
			
				Here a variant to the hangman game was asked: the user has to choose a by the program random selected word.
				At start, it is asked how long the word is that the user wants to try and find, with min 4 and max 7 letters.
				Per list, the computer can select out of 20 words.
				If the player thinks (s)he knows the word, this can be entered and will be counted as one guess.

		* End project
			* Description
			
				As end project of this module, it was asked to create a register for a shop.
				Discounts should be possible.
				If the customer pays in cash, it should be displayed how much money he will get back.
				The necessary information must be written to a ticket.
				
			* script: 
				- download link: [shop](assets/img/Senave_Alex_eindopdracht-module II.py)
				- Github link to script: ---to be added---			
			

	* ***Stock market***
		* Description
		
			This is a script which I wrote to download stock market info from Yahoo Finance website.
			
			The input is an xlsx file with the required stocks.
			A csv file will be generated with the requested information, for example
			"\<TICKER\>","\<NAME\>","\<PER\>","\<DTYYMMDD\>","\<OPEN\>","\<HIGH\>","\<LOW\>","\<CLOSE\>","\<VOL\>"
			
			Reformatting is done to obtain the info in an order/format which was needed for the application.

* ## Power BI
	* End project
		* Description
		
			The goal is to, using own data retrieved from the internet, analyse this data and create a presentation.
				
		* Result:
			* Power BI Visuals: [file](assets/img/heart_disease.pbix).
			* info and analysis: [analysis](assets/img/PowerBI-analysis.pdf).
			* presentation: [presentation](assets/img/heart_disease.pptx).
			* cleaned data: [cleaned data](assets/img/heart_2020_cleaned.csv.zip).
